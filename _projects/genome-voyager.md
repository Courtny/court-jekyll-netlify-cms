## Project Summary

Complete Genomics is a leader in accurate whole human genomic sequencing. The company’s mission is to provide researchers and clinicians the genetic information needed to improve human health by understanding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of genetic diseases and conditions. The company sought to develop an application to enable analysis of genomic information in a more user-friendly way. Universal Mind was called upon to design an intuitive iPad and web-based application for end users who were not necessarily bioinformaticians with command line programming skills.

Complete Genomics, leader in accurate whole human genome sequencing, provides researchers and clinicians with genetic information needed to improve human health – basically saving the world, one genome sequence at a time. They were looking for a user-friendly way to analyze the genetic data – information that can help with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of genetic diseases and conditions – so they reached out to Universal Mind. Yep, Universal Mind was selected to create one of the world’s first whole genome analysis and interpretation applications.

Following several discovery sessions, two months of collaboration with their expert backend team and a few short iterative test/improve cycles, Genome Voyager was launched. And, word on the street is, it’s a “glimpse of medicine’s future with slick interfaces for data”, just saying.

## Process

The project began with a Discovery phase, where the team spent a week on site with Complete Genomics diving into the project’s objectives, as well as gaining a basic understanding of human genomics. Universal Mind worked in tight collaboration with Complete Genomics’ expert back-end development team and in two months delivered a working iPad application that was ready to showcase at a major national medical conference. The team continued to execute in two-week sprints and released an alpha version of the iPad interface in spring 2013 followed by the web interface in fall of 2013. Universal Mind’s ability to make smooth course corrections resulted in rapid and efficient development of one the industry’s first whole genome analysis and interpretation applications.

## Results

The application was very well received when it was unveiled at the major national medial conference. One analyst reported that Genome Voyager was a “glimpse of genomic medicine's future with slick interfaces for data.” The alpha version of the application is currently available to an invitation only community of researchers and academics. The team continues to evolve the solution to facilitate the adoption of genomic information for improved human health.

Universal Mind was able to learn the subject matter on the fly, and over time established trust and built a strong relationship with the client’s development team. Universal Mind looks forward to building upon its successful partnership with the client as the project continues through further stages of development.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

Would you like me to help you do work similar to this?
