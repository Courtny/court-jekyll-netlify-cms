## Process

The team and I were able to start with a completely blank slate, and I was tasked with leading the design of the digital experience and the physical center console simultaneously.

Within the two month timeframe, our crew at Universal Mind delivered a working prototype of the “connected car”, with the development team pulling in services like TomTom, ParkMe, Spotify, The Weather Channel, Google Calendar, and existing AT&T services such as their Connected Home framework, which allowed users to turn off lights at home or even control their tv.

AT&T’s Emerging Devices Group was able to take their sales demonstration on the road to the car manufacturing industry, fully realizing the vision of the connected car experience.

Starting the project with a blank slate was a bonus, as Universal Mind was able to design the user experience and the physical user interface at the same time. Given the tight two-month deadline, rough initial sketches progressed quickly to wire framing, design, development and deployment.

I worked closely with the team at AT&T to integrate their Connected Home framework, which allows users to turn off lights, control their television and more with their mobile devices. The idea was that everything in your life is connected, and you should be able to take it with you wherever you go.

An emphasis was placed on safety from the very beginning. The belief was that even though a user’s phone should be out of their hands while driving, they don’t have to disconnect completely to stay safe. The screen in the front console shifts to a simpler mode with larger icons while the vehicle is in motion, for example, and video and other entertainment options are available only on the screen in the back seat.

## Designing a physical product

This was one of the coolest things I have done. Designing a physical product is an awesome experience. Seeing the final artifact in person was impressive. I worked closely with a modeler at Tekna to prototype and define the physical features of the unit. There were several requirements for the center console. Some of the requirements:

* Had to be entirely self contained.
* TSA Portable, carry-on for salesman to travel with.
* From concept to delivery in less than 2 months time.
* Dedicated router, onboard power solution.
* Mask that it's an iOS device _(No iPad chrome showing)_

## Collaborating with a Branding&trade; Team

Any project with a major brand requires a high level of diligence to ensure you're meeting guidelines and helping to expand the brand footprint in an appropriate way.

During this project, my task was to take the existing AT&T branding guidelines and expand them to an entirely new product frontier in the vehicle experience. There was not a lot of work done at this time for even touch devices, so a lot of my work was outlining new human factors guidelines, mentoring and advising the internal team on best practices, and driving adoption and agreement on brand critical decisions during this tight timeline.

Working with an existing brand can be tough sometimes, however, I managed to find a truly pleasing balance when it came to the final output.

## Results

The mock dashboard was delivered on-time and received with **butt-loads** of enthusiasm.

The prototypes our team designed and built were placed into the hands of AT&T sales representatives to take to vehicle manufacturers and showcase possibilities.

AT&T would go on to found the AT&T Drive Studio in January 2014, and is now the market leader in connected car experiences.

Legacy:

**Q3 2018 Numbers:** Nearly 27 Million Connected Vehicles; 29 Global Brands; 1 million-plus Wi-Fi hotspot subscriptions
